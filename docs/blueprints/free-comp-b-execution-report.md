# Elementeer Free Completion Batch B Execution Report

## Batch Summary

- batch_id: `FREE-COMP-B`
- items:
  - `FREE-COMP-003`
  - `FREE-COMP-004`
- sequence: [free-comp-b-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-comp-b-sequence.md)
- sequence_type: `build`
- execution_mode: `ralph_attended`
- gate_result: `continue`

## Steps Completed

- `S1`
  - made Free runtime presets more profile-aware in [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/free-runtime-wizards.ts)
  - stack profiles now affect brand-setup focus and conservative baseline notes
  - skill profiles now affect context defaults, operator posture notes, and creator defaults
  - addon profiles now affect creator sections, preset titles, and follow-up guidance for curated extension paths
  - strengthened tests in [free-runtime-wizards.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/free-runtime-wizards.test.ts)

- `S2`
  - aligned the public Free quickstart in [free.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/quickstart/free.md)
  - aligned the public Free includes/excludes summary in [free-includes-excludes.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/public/free-includes-excludes.md)
  - aligned the public README Free workflow summary in [README.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/README.md)
  - aligned the public Free product surface note in [free-product-surface.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-product-surface.md)
  - tightened the release verifier in [verify-free-release.mjs](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/scripts/verify-free-release.mjs) so the public docs must continue to reflect the scenario-first runtime story

- `S3`
  - ran targeted runtime and surface verification
  - ran Free mirror verification
  - rebuilt the deterministic Free staging artifact
  - reran the Free release verifier successfully after staging
  - hardened the TypeScript wrapper in [run-mcp-tsc.mjs](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/scripts/run-mcp-tsc.mjs) so the build/typecheck path completes more reliably through synchronous compiler execution

## Verification Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- free-runtime-wizards tools/free-runtime-wizards intent-wizard product-tiers product-surfaces tools/index`
- `npm run build --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run verify:free-mirror`
- `npm run prepare:free-mirror`
- `npm run verify:free-release`

## Verification Results

- mcp-server typecheck: `pass`
- targeted Free runtime and surface tests: `pass`
- mcp-server build: `pass`
- Free mirror verification: `pass`
- Free staging preparation: `pass`
- Free release verification: `pass`

## Review Result

- status: `continue`
- summary:
  - Free now expresses profile-aware shaping in a way users can actually feel in presets and follow-up paths
  - the public Free story is now aligned with the scenario-first runtime surface instead of lagging behind it
  - the public lock remains honest: it promises strong Free guidance and limited guided execution, but not Advanced or Studio behavior

## Known Limitations

- guided transition chaining still exists only for the earliest bootstrap and optimization paths
- the new scenario-first language is now live in Free, but the same front-door depth still needs to be mirrored on the Advanced side
- Free remains intentionally conservative about automatic execution and still keeps several steps in preview-only mode

## Next Executable Batch

1. implement `ADV-COMP-001` for the Advanced scenario front door
2. then implement `ADV-COMP-002` for deeper Advanced scenario workflows
