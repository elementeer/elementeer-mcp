# Elementeer FREE-COMP-001 Execution Report

## Batch Summary

- batch_id: `FREE-COMP-001`
- sequence: [free-comp-001-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-comp-001-sequence.md)
- sequence_type: `build`
- execution_mode: `ralph_attended`
- gate_result: `continue`

## Steps Completed

- `S1`
  - added `run_free_guided_transition` to [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/tools/free-runtime-wizards.ts)
  - implemented chained guided transitions for:
    - `stack-bootstrap`
    - `optimization-lite`
  - kept the flow scenario-first by building the transition from the routed runtime wizard plan

- `S2`
  - reused the existing preset safety contract from [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/free-runtime-wizards.ts)
  - executed only presets marked `safe_execute`
  - kept `preview_only` presets as visible preview steps inside the same transition
  - reported transition-level statuses as:
    - `preview`
    - `executed`
    - `mixed`
    - `blocked`

- `S3`
  - mapped the new helper into the Free tier in [product-tiers.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/product-tiers.ts)
  - mapped it into the Free front-door workflow in [product-surfaces.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/product-surfaces.ts)
  - updated tests in:
    - [free-runtime-wizards.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/tools/free-runtime-wizards.test.ts)
    - [product-tiers.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/product-tiers.test.ts)
    - [product-surfaces.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/product-surfaces.test.ts)

## Verification Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- free-runtime-wizards tools/free-runtime-wizards product-tiers product-surfaces tools/index`

## Verification Results

- mcp-server typecheck: `pass`
- targeted Free transition and surface tests: `pass`

## Review Result

- status: `continue`
- summary:
  - Free now supports short guided transitions instead of only isolated preset execution
  - the transition layer stays conservative and keeps preview-only steps visible rather than pretending they executed
  - the next highest-value move is to complete the missing Free scenario families, especially `new-site-lite` and `extension-lite`

## Known Limitations

- transitions remain stateless output; wizard progress is not persisted
- relaunch-lite is not yet included in guided transition execution because its preservation step still needs explicit page choice
- profile routing still influences transitions mainly through the underlying plan and preset defaults, not through a broader runtime policy layer

## Next Executable Batch

1. implement `FREE-COMP-002` for `new-site-lite`, `extension-lite`, and mapped cleanup/refresh behavior
2. then implement `FREE-COMP-003` so profile routing more strongly reshapes runtime defaults and transitions
