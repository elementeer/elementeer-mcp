# REL-COMP-001 Execution Report

## Summary

Completed the final surface and release lock for the current Free and Advanced scope.

## Verification Run

- `npm run release:free-mirror:gate`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- advanced-recommendations tools/advanced-recommendations advanced-workflows tools/advanced-workflows product-tiers product-surfaces tools/index free-runtime-wizards tools/free-runtime-wizards intent-wizard tools/intent-wizard`

## Results

### Free

- Free mirror verification passed
- Free release verification passed
- public Free docs, tool surface, and staging output remain aligned

### Advanced

- Advanced runtime surface tests passed
- scenario-first front door, deep workflows, upgrade guidance, and productivity layer remain aligned with the product surface docs

### Studio deferment

- current docs still keep cloud library, cross-site sync, delivery orchestration, and workspace cloud semantics out of active Free and Advanced promises

## Decision

- Free: `go`
- Advanced: `go`

## Remaining Risks

- No blocking release or surface inconsistencies found in this gate.
- Future work should now move into post-completion polish, wider integration coverage, or the next strategic layer rather than more foundational Free/Advanced scope churn.

## Next Best Prompt

Produce a final completion summary for Elementeer Free + Advanced:

1. what is now implemented
2. what remains intentionally deferred to Studio
3. what the public mirror can honestly claim
4. what the private Advanced layer can honestly claim
5. what the next post-completion strategic branch should be
