# Elementeer Free Preset Execution Execution Report

## Batch Summary

- batch_id: `BATCH-FREE-PRESET-EXECUTION-001`
- sequence: [free-preset-execution-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-preset-execution-sequence.md)
- sequence_type: `build`
- execution_mode: `ralph_attended`
- gate_result: `continue`

## Steps Completed

- `S1`
  - extended Free runtime action presets in [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/free-runtime-wizards.ts) with:
    - `executionMode`
    - `executionNotes`
  - marked:
    - context
    - brand dry-run
    - Creator dry-run
    as `safe_execute`
  - kept relaunch preservation, recommendation explanation, and Advanced boundary checks as `preview_only`

- `S2`
  - added `run_free_wizard_preset` in [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/tools/free-runtime-wizards.ts)
  - implemented preview and controlled execution paths for safe presets
  - reused real internal helper logic from [wizard.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/tools/wizard.ts) for:
    - Brand Setup Wizard dry run
    - Creator Mode dry run

- `S3`
  - mapped the new helper into Free product boundaries in:
    - [product-tiers.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/product-tiers.ts)
    - [product-surfaces.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/product-surfaces.ts)
  - updated tests in:
    - [free-runtime-wizards.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/tools/free-runtime-wizards.test.ts)
    - [product-tiers.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/product-tiers.test.ts)
    - [product-surfaces.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/product-surfaces.test.ts)

## Verification Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- free-runtime-wizards tools/free-runtime-wizards product-tiers product-surfaces tools/index`

## Verification Results

- mcp-server typecheck: `pass`
- targeted Free preset execution and surface tests: `pass`

## Review Result

- status: `continue`
- summary:
  - Free now has a first limited guided-execution helper instead of stopping at preset display only
  - the helper stays conservative by executing only explicitly safe presets and blocking preview-only ones
  - the next useful step is to decide whether Free should chain a small number of safe presets into short guided transitions

## Known Limitations

- recommendation explanation remains preview-only for now
- relaunch preservation still requires a real page choice and stays outside direct preset execution
- wizard state is still stateless output, not persisted session state

## Next Executable Batch

1. chain two or three safe Free presets into short guided transitions for bootstrap and optimization
2. decide whether to persist wizard state or keep the runtime layer stateless for one more iteration
3. only then move to an Advanced scenario front door above `advanced_creator_mode`
