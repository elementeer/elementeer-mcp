# SkillWeave PromptChain Execute v2

## Purpose

This document is a proposed `v2` rewrite for [`skillweave-promptchain-execute`]( /Users/andrelange/.skillweave/skills/skillweave-promptchain-execute/SKILL.md ).

It sharpens the skill around:

- explicit Ralph Loop execution
- binary gates
- critical-path vs. sidecar lane planning
- safe parallelization with write-scope ownership
- automatic escalation from `REX` to `Ralph`
- concrete batch completion and handoff contracts

It is based on:

- the current execute skill behavior
- the actual execution history in this Elementeer repo
- the `skillweave-blueprint` expectations for executable PRD-driven delivery

## Recommended v2 SKILL.md

```md

name: skillweave-promptchain-execute
description: Execute SkillWeave prompt sequences with dependency-aware batching, Ralph Loop execution, binary gates, and safe parallel subagent orchestration. Use when a validated prompt sequence or PRD-derived task set should be carried through real execution, especially for multi-step build, review, verification, release, or mixed plan/build work.

# /skillweave-promptchain-execute

**Execute structured prompt sequences with real delivery discipline.**

This skill is the execution engine for SkillWeave prompt sequences. It does not just "run steps"; it resolves execution mode, plans batches, identifies safe parallel lanes, applies Ralph Loop when the work is substantial, and advances only through binary gates.

## Usage

```text
/skillweave-promptchain-execute sequence="[prompt sequence text]" inputs="[JSON inputs]"
```

Or attach a `.md` / `.txt` sequence file and provide:

```text
/skillweave-promptchain-execute inputs='{"key":"value"}'
```

## Parameters

- `sequence` (optional if file attached): Prompt sequence text
- `inputs` (required): JSON object with required runtime inputs
- `execution_mode` (optional): `auto`, `rex`, `ralph_attended`, `ralph_overnight`
- `audience_mode` (optional): `auto`, `humanize`, `machinize`, `mixed`

Default:

- `execution_mode = auto`
- `audience_mode = auto`

## Core Distinctions

### 1. Sequence Type

Sequence type describes the nature of the work:

- `plan`: strategy, analysis, PRD, architecture, research-led planning
- `build`: code, config, tests, infra, docs tied to implementation
- `mixed`: both plan and build steps are materially present

### 2. Execution Mode

Execution mode describes how the work should be carried out:

- `rex`: fast path for small, low-risk, mostly linear work
- `ralph_attended`: default for substantial repo work with active checkpoints
- `ralph_overnight`: autonomous multi-batch execution for large, well-structured sequences

`mixed` is **not** an execution mode. It is only a sequence-type classification.

## Mode Resolution

If `execution_mode=auto`, choose as follows:

### Use `rex` when:

- there are 1-3 steps
- total work is small
- dependencies are mostly linear
- there is no meaningful public/private or release boundary risk
- verification is lightweight

### Use `ralph_attended` when:

- there are 4+ steps
- the work mutates a repository
- code, tests, docs, or release flow are all involved
- binary gates are required
- public/private or product-tier boundaries are involved
- multiple safe parallel lanes exist

### Use `ralph_overnight` when:

- the sequence is already decomposed into explicit batches
- batch gates are well-defined
- retries and carry-forward logic are already specified
- long autonomous execution is acceptable

Rule of thumb:

- default to `ralph_attended` for real product development unless the task is obviously tiny

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Preflight

1. Detect sequence type: `plan`, `build`, or `mixed`
2. Validate required inputs
3. Parse dependencies
4. Identify:
   - critical path
   - safe parallel lanes
   - review gates
   - release or deployment risk
5. Resolve execution mode
6. Determine whether the sequence should run:
   - as one batch
   - as multiple batches
   - with sidecar subagents

If the sequence is malformed, underspecified, or contradicts the real repository baseline, stop and produce a baseline-alignment report before executing.

### Phase 2: Batch Planning

Before implementation, convert the sequence into executable batches.

For each batch, define:

- `batch_id`
- `goal`
- `included_steps`
- `critical_path_step`
- `parallel_lanes`
- `write_surfaces`
- `verification_commands`
- `review_gate`
- `completion_contract`
- `next_batch_if_pass`
- `fallback_if_fail`

Do not execute a multi-step build sequence without first producing an explicit batch plan.

### Phase 3: Ralph Loop State Machine

When execution mode is `ralph_attended` or `ralph_overnight`, use this loop:

1. `Preflight`
2. `Batch Selection`
3. `Lane Plan`
4. `Implement`
5. `Verify`
6. `Review Gate`
7. `Fix / Retry`
8. `Integrate`
9. `Advance or Stop`

Only advance when the current batch passes its binary gate.

## Parallelization Rules

Parallelism is allowed only when it is safe.

### Safe parallel lanes

Parallelize steps when they have:

- disjoint write scopes
- no unresolved dependency between them
- no shared ownership of fragile contract surfaces

Good sidecar lanes:

- read-only research
- documentation drafting
- isolated tests
- release notes
- audit and verification passes

### Keep local on the critical path

Keep the following local unless the sequence explicitly isolates them:

- product-tier registries
- tool index / tool registration
- shared contracts used across many modules
- release and export manifests
- other single-owner integration surfaces

### Subagent policy

Use subagents only for:

- independent sidecar lanes
- isolated implementation with disjoint write scope
- verification or review that does not block immediate local context-building

Do not delegate the immediate blocking task if the next local action depends on it.

## Required Build-Step Fields

For build-oriented execution, each implementation step should define or be normalized into:

- `id`
- `title`
- `depends_on`
- `required_capabilities`
- `write_scope`
- `verification`
- `integration_gate`
- `retry_budget`
- `handoff_contract`

If these are missing, infer them conservatively. If they cannot be inferred safely, stop and emit a sequence-hardening recommendation.

## Gate Policy

All meaningful completion decisions must be binary.

Allowed completion signals:

- tests passed
- verifier passed
- build succeeded
- review explicitly returned `continue`
- required artifact exists and matches the contract

Not sufficient on their own:

- "looks good"
- "seems fine"
- "mostly done"
- "probably works"

If verification is inconclusive, mark the batch `inconclusive`, explain why, and do not silently advance.

## Audience Handling

After execution, outputs may be shaped for:

- `humanize`: explanation-first deliverables
- `machinize`: structured machine-readable outputs
- `mixed`: both

Do not ask about audience mode if the sequence or context already makes it obvious.

## Output Contract

### For each batch, return:

- `batch_id`
- `steps_completed`
- `files_changed`
- `commands_run`
- `verification_results`
- `review_result`
- `blockers`
- `known_limitations`
- `next_executable_batch`

### For plan-oriented outputs, return:

- decision summary
- assumptions
- unresolved questions
- artifacts produced
- recommended next execution package

### For build-oriented outputs, return:

- implementation summary
- exact verification steps
- pass/fail/inconclusive status
- next slice recommendation

## Failure Handling

If a batch fails:

1. identify whether the failure is:
   - implementation
   - verification
   - environment
   - sequence-definition
2. apply the retry budget if appropriate
3. prefer narrow fixes over broad redesign
4. if still blocked, stop and emit:
   - blocker summary
   - affected batch
   - safe rollback or pause point
   - next required user or system action

Do not continue into the next batch after a failed gate.

## Integration with ReleaseChain

Offer `/skillweave-releasechain` only when:

- build-oriented work completed successfully
- outputs are in a reviewable state
- the next logical step is review, test hardening, commit, release, or PR flow

Do not automatically transfer partial or inconclusive build batches into ReleaseChain.

## Agent-Agnostic Execution

This skill is agent-agnostic.

It should prefer:

- capability-based routing
- lane-based task assignment
- central ownership of critical-path integration
- fallback to available agents when the preferred capability runner is unavailable

When multiple agents exist, assign by:

- capability fit
- write-scope safety
- dependency position
- verification needs

Do not encode vendor-specific assumptions into the execution logic.

## Recommended Companion Files

Use these files if present:

- `references/execution-rules.md`
- `references/format-spec.md`
- `references/sequence-type-detection.md`
- `references/parallel-execution.md`
- `references/ralph-loop-state-machine.md`
- `references/build-step-normalization.md`
- `references/gate-policy.md`
```

## Key Changes From Current Skill

### 1. `mixed` is demoted from mode to sequence property

This removes a recurring ambiguity and cleanly separates:

- what kind of work the sequence contains
- how the sequence should be executed

### 2. Ralph Loop becomes explicit instead of implied

The current skill mentions parallel execution and adaptive behavior, but not a real iteration machine. The v2 version introduces:

- batch planning
- fixed Ralph Loop states
- gate-driven advance logic

### 3. Parallelization becomes conditional and safer

The current skill says "execute independent steps in parallel when possible." The v2 version adds:

- write-scope awareness
- critical-path protection
- sidecar lane rules
- subagent restrictions

### 4. Binary completion becomes mandatory

The skill now treats:

- pass
- fail
- inconclusive

as first-class outcomes, instead of allowing soft advancement.

### 5. Build steps are normalized into executable contracts

This is the key upgrade for real repo work. It prevents vague steps from collapsing into freestyle implementation.

## Recommended Follow-On Files

To make the skill actually strong in practice, add these references next:

- `references/ralph-loop-state-machine.md`
- `references/build-step-normalization.md`
- `references/gate-policy.md`

These should remain short and procedural, not essay-like.

## Migration Recommendation

Adopt this in two steps:

1. replace the existing `SKILL.md` body with the `v2` content above
2. add the three new reference files so the skill stays concise while gaining sharper runtime behavior

Do not try to encode every edge case directly into `SKILL.md`. Keep `SKILL.md` as the operator contract and push detailed heuristics into small reference files.
