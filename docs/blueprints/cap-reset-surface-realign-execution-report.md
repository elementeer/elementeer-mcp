# Elementeer CAP-RESET-001 + SURFACE-REALIGN-002 Execution Report

## Batch Summary

- batch_id: `BATCH-CAP-SURFACE-001`
- sequence: [cap-reset-surface-realign-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/cap-reset-surface-realign-sequence.md)
- sequence_type: `mixed`
- execution_mode: `ralph_attended`
- gate_result: `continue`

## Batch Plan

### Critical path

- `S1 — Capability Reset Foundation`

### Safe sidecar lanes

- `S2 — Free Surface Realignment`
- `S3 — Advanced Surface Realignment`

### Integration gate

- `GATE A — Consistency Review`

## Steps Completed

- `S1`
  - created [capability-reset.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/capability-reset.md)
  - reframed [tier-capability-map.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/tier-capability-map.md) as implementation boundary, not product truth

- `S2`
  - updated [free-product-surface.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-product-surface.md)
  - Free now explicitly covers bootstrap, existing-site uplift, agent-native/skill-facing entry, and 360-degree starting-point semantics

- `S3`
  - updated [advanced-product-surface.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/advanced-product-surface.md)
  - Advanced now reads as the deeper scenario-execution and productivity layer, not only as an extra-feature tier

- `GATE A`
  - updated [free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.md) with third-batch artifacts

## Files Changed

- [capability-reset.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/capability-reset.md)
- [free-product-surface.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-product-surface.md)
- [advanced-product-surface.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/advanced-product-surface.md)
- [tier-capability-map.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/tier-capability-map.md)
- [free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.md)
- [cap-reset-surface-realign-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/cap-reset-surface-realign-sequence.md)

## Verification Commands

- `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('docs/blueprints/free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.json','utf8')); console.log('ok')"`
- `rtk grep -n "FSP-1|ASP-1|Skill profiles|Addon profiles|Elementor Pro solves|Elementeer Advanced solves|The second batch now has dedicated artifacts" docs/blueprints/stack-profiles.md docs/blueprints/skill-addon-architecture.md docs/blueprints/upgrade-guidance.md docs/blueprints/free-advanced-scenario-wizard-prd-v2.md`
- `rtk read docs/blueprints/free-product-surface.md`
- `rtk read docs/blueprints/advanced-product-surface.md`
- `rtk read docs/blueprints/tier-capability-map.md`

## Review Result

- status: `continue`
- summary:
  - the upper product model and lower technical boundary model are now clearly separated
  - Free and Advanced both align more closely with the scenario-first, wizard-first blueprint
  - the capability layer is reset conceptually without prematurely hard-coding a new runtime permission model

## Known Limitations

- [auth.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/shared/src/types/auth.ts) still contains the older mixed capability vocabulary and remains a transitional implementation state
- runtime tool routing and admin/governance capability UI are not yet remapped to the reset model
- the generated sequence was applied as a documentation-first batch; no runtime capability code was changed yet

## Next Executable Batch

1. translate the reset model into a typed domain capability source of truth
2. realign admin/governance grouping to the new domain model
3. remap tool and endpoint enforcement from the mixed resource vocabulary to the new domain vocabulary with transitional aliases where needed
