# Elementeer Free Runtime Wizard Handoff Tightening Execution Report

## Batch Summary

- batch_id: `BATCH-FREE-RUNTIME-HANDOFFS-001`
- sequence: [free-runtime-wizard-handoffs-sequence.md](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/docs/blueprints/free-runtime-wizard-handoffs-sequence.md)
- sequence_type: `build`
- execution_mode: `ralph_attended`
- gate_result: `continue`

## Steps Completed

- `S1`
  - extended [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/free-runtime-wizards.ts) with structured operative handoffs per wizard family
  - added explicit tool, timing, reason, and example call shape for bootstrap, optimization-lite, and relaunch-lite follow-on steps

- `S2`
  - added explicit profile-application output for:
    - stack profile
    - skill profile
    - addon profile
  - translated profiles into practical downstream behavior instead of keeping them as descriptive labels only

- `S3`
  - rendered the new operative handoff and profile-application sections in [free-runtime-wizards.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/tools/free-runtime-wizards.ts)
  - updated tests in:
    - [free-runtime-wizards.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/free-runtime-wizards.test.ts)
    - [free-runtime-wizards.test.ts](/Users/andrelange/Documents/repositories/github/elementeer-mcp/mcp-server/src/__tests__/tools/free-runtime-wizards.test.ts)

## Verification Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- free-runtime-wizards tools/free-runtime-wizards`

## Verification Results

- mcp-server typecheck: `pass`
- targeted runtime wizard tests: `pass`

## Review Result

- status: `continue`
- summary:
  - the new Free runtime wizard families now move closer to guided execution instead of remaining purely descriptive
  - stack, skill, and addon profiles now have practical consequences in the output
  - the next strongest value is to turn some of these example handoffs into stronger action presets or limited execution transitions

## Known Limitations

- the handoffs are still example-driven, not one-click executable chains
- profile applications shape the guidance output, but do not yet reshape downstream tool parameter defaults globally
- the wizard layer is still stateless and non-persistent

## Next Executable Batch

1. add stronger action presets for recommendation explanation, brand setup, and Creator Light
2. decide whether the next priority is:
   - deeper Free runtime execution
   - or matching Advanced runtime uplift
