# ADV-COMP-D Execution Report

## Summary

Completed `ADV-COMP-003` and `ADV-COMP-004` by adding scenario-aware runtime upgrade guidance and a clearer productivity layer across Advanced workflows.

- `docs/blueprints/advanced-product-surface.md`

## Behavior Added

- Added `plan_advanced_upgrade_path` as a scenario-aware Advanced runtime seam.
- Added upgrade/runtime distinctions for:
  - current stack is enough
  - Elementor Pro for builder / structural gaps
  - Elementeer Advanced for workflow depth
  - curated supported pro-addon profile when scenario-fit is strong
- Added Advanced recommendation tracks:
  - `upgrade-guidance`
  - `productivity`
- Added a productivity layer to Advanced workflow and scenario outputs:
  - variant moves
  - reuse-light moves
  - follow-up mode
  - time-saving moves
- Realigned Advanced product surfaces around runtime stack shaping and productivity value.

## Exact Test Commands

- `npm run typecheck --workspace=mcp-server`
- `npm run test --workspace=mcp-server -- advanced-recommendations tools/advanced-recommendations advanced-workflows tools/advanced-workflows product-tiers product-surfaces tools/index`

## Assumptions Made

- Advanced should expose its upgrade reasoning explicitly rather than hiding it inside generic recommendation prose.
- Productivity gains should be visible directly inside Advanced scenario and workflow outputs, not only implied through deeper tools.

## Known Limitations

- Upgrade guidance remains deterministic and recommendation-oriented; it does not yet auto-apply stack changes.
- Productivity guidance is now explicit, but some reuse-light moves still depend on follow-on execution slices instead of one-click chaining.

## Next Best Prompt

Run the final completion lock:

1. perform the final Free + Advanced surface and release gate
2. verify Free mirror safety again
3. verify Advanced runtime promises against the implemented tools and docs
4. produce the final Go / No-Go summary
